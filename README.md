In this project we'll attempt to train a neural network to land a rocket [Ã  la SpaceX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0-pfzKbh2k) in a simple physics simulation. 

#### Download the materials with [this link](https://github.com/ShafiatD/Landing-a-Rocket-Using-Machine-Learning/archive/master.zip)

#### You will need to install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation) (in that order) before we start.

#### Running [Mode0](https://github.com/ShafiatD/Landing-a-Rocket-Using-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Mode1.py) will give our solution for Mode 0, likewise for [Mode1](https://github.com/ShafiatD/Landing-a-Rocket-Using-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Mode1.py).
